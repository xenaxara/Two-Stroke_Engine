I've made a 3 cylinder 2 stroke engine on the 3D printer to show my students how the engine works.
There are about 100 Neopixels in 3 groups which are all set of by an Absolute Rotary Encoder at different degrees of Crankshat rotation.
I've shown the three different types of induction: Crankshaft Port, Piston Port and Vacuum or Reed Valve.
The STL files will be up on Thingiverse.com if you want to make one
